  Translations for Conozco Numeros
 ==================================

1) Be sure the code can handle i18n

You should add the following import statement in every Python text
file that you want to translate:

  from gettext import gettext as _


2) Generate translation files

These steps must be performed every time translatable strings are added to the code
or a new translation is added.

The example is for a Spanish translation.


cd $HOME/Activities/ConozcoNumeros.activity

# Generate the "po/ConozcoNumeros.pot" file:
TEMP_DIR=/tmp/temp_dir_$$
[ -d $TEMP_DIR ] && /bin/rm -rf $TEMP_DIR
/bin/mkdir $TEMP_DIR
/bin/mv olpcgames recursos $TEMP_DIR
./setup.py fix_manifest
./setup.py genpot
/bin/mv $TEMP_DIR/* .
/bin/rmdir $TEMP_DIR

# Complete the first lines of the "po/ConozcoNumeros.pot" file with the version
# information, your e-mail, etc.
# Initialize a translation file for a given language (e.g. Spanish):
cd po
msginit -o es.po -l es
# The former command creates file "es.po", which should contain the Spanish
# translation. The command will ask for the e-mail of the "Last-Translator" attribute of
# the ".po" file. You may also see some errors about a "team-address" file not found,
# but the translation file is created anyway.


Modify the "es.po" file to add the Spanish translations.
Make sure the charset in the ".po" file is UTF-8. There should be a line like this one:
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"

The "locale" folder is automagically generated when the bundle is generated.
Thus, you will not see the translation or any changes made to it until you rebuild the bundle.



Rebuild the bundle
------------------

1) Update the NEWS file with any relevant information

2) Increment the version number in "activity/activity.info" (this is important
   to avoid having to bundles with the same name but different content).

3) Erase stale data

   /bin/rm -rf locale MANIFEST
 
4) Generate the bundle:

  ./setup.py fix_manifest
  ./setup.py dist_xo

The new bundle will be in the (recently created) "dist" folder.
